## Wikispeedia
Wikispeedia is an online game created using a subset of articles from wikipedia. It is a graph containing 4598 articles represented by nodes and 119754 links represented by edges. The game is played by users starting from a given article chosen randomly and trying to reach a given target article by clicking on the links found on every article.
## Motivation
We would like to understand how humans look for information on the internet and how we can make it easier to find this information. In this sense, Wikispeedia can be considered a good model of the web, as the users donâ€™t know how the entire graph is connected and they have to find a way to navigate through it. 
By analyzing the different behaviors of the users we can determine not only how the users think about this problem but also how we can make it easier for them to find the information that they need.
